# Desktop Bill System for Real Clean Center

The **Desktop Bill System** is a software application built using Python, SQLite, and PyQt5 framework. It's designed to facilitate the generation, consultation, searching, and reporting of bills for the **Real Clean Center**. This project showcases my skills in software development and serves as a valuable addition to my web portfolio.
